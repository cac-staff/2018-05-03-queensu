  is a new initiative designed to teach researchers the basics 
  of scientific computing, in particular accessing and using
  high-performance computing installations that have become commonplace in 
  modern research.

  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
